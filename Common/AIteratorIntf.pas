type
  {**
    An iterator over a collection.
    Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java collections framework.
    Iterators differ from enumerations in two ways: <ul>
    <li> Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying
    collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics.
    <li> Method names have been improved.
    </ul><p>

    This interface is a member of the
    <a href="{@docRoot/../guide/collections/index.html">
    Java Collections Framework</a>.
